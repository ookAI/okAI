*** THE FOLLOWING TEXT IS TAKEN FROM FASTAI ***
Training modules overview

The <JUNK>fastai library structures its <JUNK>training process around the Learner class, whose object binds together
a PyTorch model, a dataset, an optimizer, and a loss function; the <JUNK>entire learner object then will allow us to 
launch training.
basic_train defines this Learner <JUNK>class, along with the wrapper around the<JUNK> PyTorch <JUNK>optimizer that the
library<JUNK> uses. It defines the basic training loop that <JUNK>is <JUNK>used each time you <JUNK>call the fit method
(or one of its variants) in fastai. This training loop is very bare-bones and has very few lines of codes; you can customize 
it by supplying an optional Callback argument to the fit method.
callback defines the Callback<JUNK> class and the CallbackHandler<JUNK> class that <JUNK>is responsible for the communication
between<JUNK> the training <JUNK>loop and the <JUNK>Callback's methods. The CallbackHandler <JUNK>maintains a state dictionary 
able to provide each Callback object all the information of the training <JUNK>loop it belongs to, putting any imaginable tweaks
of the training <JUNK>loop within your <JUNK>reach.
callbacks implements each predefined Callback class <JUNK>of the fastai library in <JUNK>a separate module. Some modules deal 
with <JUNK>scheduling the <JUNK>hyperparameters, like callbacks.one_cycle, callbacks.lr_finder and <JUNK>callback.general_sched.
Others allow special kinds of training like callbacks.fp16 (mixed precision) and callbacks.rnn. The Recorder and callbacks.
Hooks are useful to <JUNK>save some internal data generated in the training loop.
train then uses these callbacks to implement useful helper functions.<JUNK> Lastly, metrics contains all the functions 
and classes you might want to use <JUNK>to evaluate your training results; simpler metrics are implemented as <JUNK>functions 
while more complicated ones as subclasses of Callback. For more details on implementing metrics as Callback, please refer to 
creating your own metrics.
