sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression
class sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression(fit_intercept=True, normalize=False, copy_X=True, n_jobs=None)
Parameters:	
fit_intercept : boolean, optional, default True
whether to calculate the intercept for this model. If set to False, no intercept will be used in calculations 

(e.g. data is expected to be already centered).

normalize : bool, optional, default False
This parameter is ignored when fit_intercept is set to False. If True, the regressors X will be normalized before regression by subtracting the mean and dividing by the l2-norm. If you wish to standardize, please use sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler before calling fit on an estimator with normalize=False.

copy_X : boolean, optional, default True
If True, X will be copied; else, it may be overwritten.

n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
The number of jobs to use for the computation. This will only provide speedup for n_targets > 1 and sufficient 
large problems. None means 1 unless in a joblib.parallel_backend context. -1 means using all processors. 
See Glossary for more details.
Attributes:	
coef_ : array, shape (n_features, ) or (n_targets, n_features)
Estimated coefficients for the linear regression problem. If multiple targets are passed during the fit (y 2D), 
this is a 2D array of shape (n_targets, n_features),while if only one target is passed, this is a 1D array of
length n_features.

intercept_ : array

Independent term in the linear model.
